# San-Francisco-Airbnb-Price-Prediction
Springboard Capstone Project #2_Christina Qinxin Yang

Background:
Airbnb has been in a rising start in the collaborative economy/sharing economy era. During its IPO in 2020, it raised more than 3.4 billion USD which set a record high for U.S. tech companies.

Airbnbâ€™s business model is simple but yet sophisticated. It attracts and manages 2 customer segments: hosts and travelers by providing a seamless online booking experience. In order to maintain economic equilibrium between the 2 customer segments, it is crucial to determine a fair value pricing model that can predict accurately the pricing for the listed properties based on locations, size, and other unique characteristics and constraints. 

Such pricing model is also useful to potential homeowners who are considering listing their properties on Airbnb and eager to learn how much cash flow the property can generate before really listing it.

We can build a prediction model to forecast what drives the San Francisco Airbnb price and learn why certain  listings are hotter than others using the San Francisco Airbnb listing database and safety scoring zip codes datasets

Data set #1: https://www.kaggle.com/jeploretizo/san-francisco-airbnb-listings
Data set #2: https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/san-francisco/crime

The 1st dataset contains 100+ features so Data Wrangling is crucial as it helps us understand the columns and data completeness. We can eliminate some of the columns and rows if the data is incomplete. The 2nd dataset contains the neighborhood crime rate that we can bring into the analysis and use it as an indicator for the safety level of each neighborhood.
